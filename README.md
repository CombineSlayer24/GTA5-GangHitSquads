# GTA5 GangHitSquads .NET Script
A .NET script that ports a GTA IV Script by the name of (GangRampage) into Grand Theft Auto 5.

This script is very work in progress. While the core works, some stuff is yet to be added, like vehicle hitman spawns, ect.

# Requirements
You will need the latest version of Grand Theft Auto 5 (v1.0.3411.0), [ScriptHookV](https://dev-c.com/GTAV/scripthookv), [ScriptHookVDotNet3 - Nightly Compile Version](https://github.com/scripthookvdotnet/scripthookvdotnet-nightly/releases/latest)

# Installation
To install, Press the green button that says "code". THen hit "Download Zip". Once downloaded, drag `GTA5GangHitSquads.dll` & `GTA5GangHitSquads.ini` to `Grand Theft Auto V\scripts`.

# TODO
 - Vehicle Hitmen
 
- .INI Config Options
  - Difficulty Option. Set various options based on the difficulty preset selected. (Health, Armor, Accuracy, the amount of hitmen, the frequency of spawns, ect.)
  - Reduce Police presence. (During an active attack, lessen the police presence to make attacks more survivalable.)
  - Payout. Set the minimum and maximum randomized payout upon surviving an attack.
  - Timed Attacks. Make it to where it is timed and not ended by the Player. Same for starting.

- LemonUI Support
  - Instead of a Keybind to start/end attacks, navigate the menu to activate one, freeing a keybind space.
  - On the fly `.ini` option changes.
